# github95
A Windows 95 based [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) theme for Github, based heavily off (read: blatantly stolen from) [nikitonsky's tweet](https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1003593821723267072)

Its very unfinished, but if yiu want to use it, just copy the contents of `github95.css` into a new Stylish theme

It works on my computer; Vivaldi at 1080p, otherwise ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
